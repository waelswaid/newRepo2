        "correctAnswer": "2x",
        "explanation": "The derivative of x^2 is calculated using the power rule: d/dx[x^n] = n * x^(n-1). Here, n = 2, so the derivative is 2x."

        "correctAnswer": "ln(x)",
        "explanation": "The integral of 1/x is ln(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This is a standard result in calculus."

        "correctAnswer": "ad - bc",
        "explanation": "The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is calculated as (a * d) - (b * c)."

        "correctAnswer": "Number of non-zero rows",
        "explanation": "The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). It is determined by counting the non-zero rows in its row echelon form."
